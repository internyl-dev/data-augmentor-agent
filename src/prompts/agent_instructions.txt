The following is the instructions for writing information in the schema. Follow each of these instructions STRICTLY.

Search suggestion: for sections that you need information for, search up the name of the target internship + the section.
Example 1: To get the deadlines for the BRAINYAC program, query "brainyac deadline".
Example 2: To get the dates for a the Summer 2025 term for the ARISE program, query "arise summer 2025 dates".

GLOBAL RULES:
- Do NOT infer, guess, or hallucinate information.
- Use "not provided" for missing text fields or categories.
- Use mm-dd-yyyy for all dates or just the year, or month and year if that is the only information given.
- Do not include any rationale or explanation in the output—just structured values.

SECTION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. OVERVIEW:
- "title": Use the full program name
- "provider": The organization running the program.
- "description": A concise summary, directly quoted or reworded from mission/program overview.
- "link": A direct URL to the program or application if provided.
- "subject": List stated academic topics (e.g., biology, computer science).
  - It is acceptable for subjects to be derived from hiring skillsets or offered courses
  - If no direct subject can be found, infer at least one subject based on the name or description, or if absolutely not clear, put "various".
- "tags": Use literal keywords (e.g., "free", "residential", "virtual", etc.).

2. ELIGIBILITY:
- "essay_required", "recommendation_required", "transcript_required": Use true, false, or "not provided".
- "other": List any extra requirements (e.g., "An interview is required").
- "grades": Convert stated grades (e.g., 11th) into ["Junior"], and use "Rising" only if explicitly stated (e.g., "Rising Seniors").
- "age": Fill "minimum" and "maximum" with numeric values only if exact ages or age ranges are given.

Never infer age from grade or vice versa.

3. DATES:
- "deadlines": For each deadline found, fill all subfields:
  - "name" (e.g., "Priority Deadline", "Final Application Deadline")
  - "priority" ("high" only for the most important application deadline, "medium"/"low" for others)
  - "term", "date", "rolling_basis", and "time" — use "not provided" if not stated.
- "dates": Include program term, start, and end dates only if both dates are provided. Leave subfields as "not provided" if only partial data is available.
  - Providing only the month for dates where the days aren't given is acceptable (e.g. "September 2026")
  - If the year isn't provided, it is safe to assume that it refers to the current year
- "duration_weeks": Use a number only if clearly stated (e.g., "6-week program" → 6); otherwise "not provided".

Never derive exact duration from vague phrases like “a few weeks”.

4. LOCATIONS:
- "virtual": Use:
  - true — if the program is explicitly online only
  - false — if explicitly in-person
  - "hybrid" — if the program combines online and in-person in one experience
  - "both available" — if users can choose between online or in-person
  - "not provided" — if unclear
- "state", "city", "address": Only fill if explicitly stated in the text.

Do not infer the location based on provider, university, or assumptions.

5. COSTS:
Each cost-related item gets its own object:
- "name": Label of the cost (e.g., Tuition, Housing).
- "free": true only if clearly stated. If true, both "lowest" and "highest" must be null.
- "lowest" / "highest": Use only numeric values if explicitly stated (e.g., $2500). Else use "not provided".
- "financial-aid-available": true, false, or "not provided".

Stipend:
- "available": true if explicitly mentioned; false if explicitly absent; "not provided" if unclear.
- "amount": Use numeric value only if stated. If "available" is false, set amount to null.

Never calculate cost or stipend from scattered clues.

6. CONTACT:
Include only the most relevant applicant-facing contact info:
- "email": Must be a complete email address found directly in the content.
- "phone": Must be a valid phone number with format (e.g., 123-456-7890).
- If not explicitly present, use "not provided".

Never extract contact info from headers, footers, or social links unless it appears clearly in main content.

Fill out as much information as possible in this schema; any information that cannot be found after a dedicated search can be left as "not provided".
